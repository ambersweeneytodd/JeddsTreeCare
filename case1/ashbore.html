<h1>The Emerald Ash Borer</h1>
<img src="emerald-ash-borer.jpg" alt="beetle yo">
<p>Lately there's has been a problem with a species known as the Emerald Ash borer. Because of this,
we have decided to let people know about why this is a huge problem and clear up some quick questions about it.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>What is the Emerald Ash Borer?</h2>
<br><br>
<p>The Emerald Ash Borer - or commonly referred to as EAB - is a emerald green beetle that was discovered in Southeastern Michigan
and <br> in the summer of 2002. The adult bettles eat on ash foliage from an ash tree (the only tree it eats) </p>
<br><br>
<h2>Why is this a big deal?</h2>
<br><br>
<p>While the adult beetle may not cause too much trouble, it's the larvae that causes the real issues. The larvae
(the immature stage of the beetle) feed on the inner bark of the ash tree, disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients.
Now because of this, hundreds <br> of millions of Ash trees now are dead in just the US alone. As of now, the problem only gets worse
with 31 states reporting they too have <br>the beetle.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Where did they come from?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>While we don't have a true origin to where this beetle came from to get here, most scientists suggest that the EAB came to the US through solid wood
packing material from Asia - their native country.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>What can we do about it?</h2>
<br><br>
<p>While we don't have an exact solution to this problem, the best course of action so far is to remove the trees while we can.
